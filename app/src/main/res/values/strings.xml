    <string name="about_description">Lowcost kitchen is a selection of recipes for a week\'s worth of meals.
    It is designed to help you save money, and to prevent food waste. You are provided with a list of ingredients
    to buy that will last you one week, that are readily available in most grocery stores. By the end of the week,
    if you follow the recipes for each day, you will have an empty refrigerator and will have spent under 30
    dollars for all of your food for the week. To put that into perspective, only 8% of Americans spend less than 50 dollars a week.
